# So glad you're here...

Please sit down. Have a la croix.

This is a blog that exists for a number of reasons.

1. To get my feet wet in the world of Gatsby JS and talk all things technology and web development to you, someone who might care.
2. So I can tell you what I ate the other day.
    - Hint: It was an everything bagel
3. The beer I'm drinking
    - Hint: It's probably [from Captain Lawrence](https://www.captainlawrencebrewing.com/)
4. Music that tickles my fancy.

Yeah that's it...stay tuned!
