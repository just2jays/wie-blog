The COVID-19 pandemic has forced many employees to work in places and conditions that they
weren't quite accustomed to.

For me, working "remotely" seemed like a dream.
I have a comfy couch, it's right in front of a large TV. My fridge is stocked with seemingly
every flavor of La Croix seltzer in existence. This was the mindset back in March. It's now October...
and the novelty has worn off.

There's no doubt that [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) has become the de facto standard for remote communication in a professional
environment (maybe closely tied with [Slack](https://slack.com)?) - but come on your team/friends/squad/compadres might be looking for something a bit
more relaxed. Dare I say, you might even _miss_ the sounds of your cubemate eating ramen or being able to quickly bounce an idea off
the person seated next to you.

If you fall into the latter category then I have some good news. There has been a steady stream of websites, chatrooms, and other tools
that have sprung up amidst the pandemic that seek to quench your thirst for the office. The key to most, if not all of the good ones?
The webcam that's built into almost every new computer these days and the coming of age of **Spatial Audio**.

# What is Spatial Audio?
Spatial audio is sound that is _simulated_ to appear as if it's occuring in the 360 degree space surrounding you. Just as you would perceive it as if it were happening in the real-world environment.

_For example,_ if someone whipsers something from _directly_ behind you in the real world, you would hear it clearly.
If that same person takes 10 steps backwards and whispers the same thing, you can no longer hear it.

This is how spatial audio works in a _virtual_ environment. IF you're within the area that the sound is occuring, you can hear it coming from that direction.
If you're outside of the area of the sound, you do not hear it. This allows for multiple converstaions to be occurring in a single environment that users
can choose to hear, or not here, simply by moving out of the zone.

When done effectively, it makes online meetings or social gatherings seem less like you're talking into a flat metal screen and more like the real thing
(at least from what I can rememeber!) Here is a set of tools that I've found get the job done really well:

# The Tools
## Gather Town
<p><strong>Link:</strong> <a href="https://gather.town/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://gather.town</a></p>
<em>Gather Town</em> takes the cake as my personal favorite tool for both a productive remote work experience with the option
to crank the fun up to 11 if you want.

It's all here:
- Tiny customizable avatars let people express themselves.
- A set of prebuilt "maps" or environments for aformetnioned avatars to roam.
- Spatial audio AND video. (In other words you can only hear, and see, those people who are within a certain vicinity of your avatar.)
- The ability to create _custom_ 2D maps for your avatars to roam (I may or may not have spent a weekend crafting our office for the team to use.)
- Join or Host up to 25 years simultaneously **for free**; Premium spaces for an hourly, daily, monthly basis from ~$1 - $22 depending on the features.
- Screenshare capability!

My team found this tool as a means of having a pint together at the end of a fruitful week. I signed into the office Slack that next Monday to a
message: "We're all working at our desks in Gather Town, come on in." - the team had officially adopted it as the office away from the office. 
I think yours might too.

## here.fm
<p><strong>Link:</strong> <a href="https://here.fm/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://here.fm/</a></p>
<em>Here</em> is a different approach to the shared virtual environment. Instead of trying to simulate a real environment, like an office, the users in a room actually _create_ the environment. The page is essentially a canvas and each user can draw, write text, upload and attach images/videos/gifs. You can use it for team presentations. You can use it to host trivia or play hangman with some off time. Think of it as a _giant_ whiteboard. Use it how you want, it is what you make it!

- Easily add your own text or upload your own files for everyone to see.
- Support for embedding YouTube videos for users to watch simultaneously.
- Live user webcams and spatial audio support
- Built in Google Calendar integration for scheduling meetings
- **FREE** (From what I can tell, no pricing or premium plans required)

This is a great option for say, a design team or a group of creative people. You can work together to create an awesome space for both work & play.

## SpatialChat
<p><strong>Link:</strong> <a href="https://spatial.chat/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://spatial.chat/</a></p>
The name, <em>SpatialChat</em>, says it all. (If you don't know what to expect from this service by now....please scroll back to the top!) Here you get a really straightforward and accessible room with spatial audio capability. As mentioned in a few other descriptions, you are again a small colored dot among a bunch of small colored dots (other users). The closer the dots, the better audio.

- Spatial Audio and Video sharing
- Screenshare capability!
- Multiple rooms in a space (for instance your "Office" space might have a "Meeting Hall", "Reception", and "Water Cooler" rooms)
- **Free** private room for up to 4 users; $50+/mo for premium features

## CozyRoom
<p><strong>Link:</strong> <a href="https://cozyroom.xyz/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://cozyroom.xyz</a></p>
<em>CozyRoom</em> sees your simulated-real-world-environment, and raises it to a whole new level. Sure it has "room" in it's name but they don't ask you 
to create a simple room. Instead they ask you for _an address_...like the kind you would send snail mail too. (Their example? **37 Cozy Avenue**) - so right away, you feel like you're really _somewhere_ and it incentivizes sharing. The emphasis here again, spatial audio, and I have to say that CozyRoom's implementation
might be the best of the bunch. Crisp audio that fades in and out as the distance between you and the user talking comes/and goes. Each room starts pretty basic
but you are given a set of free objects which you can use to decoarate different areas. Trees, charis, 

The good:
- GREAT spatial audio implementation
- A pre-defined set of objects you can use to decorate and make each room uniquely yours

The bad:
- NO video! (Audio only at the time of writing)

## DJ3D
<p><strong>Link:</strong> <a href="https://dj3d.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://dj3d.io/</a></p>
<em>DJ3D</em> is the only service here that takes 3D audio and combines it with a truly 3D environment. You and all other users are represented as a sort of 3D stick
figure. The face is represented of course by your face 

- Spatial Audio and Video
- Fully 3D environment, can run, jump, and climb on obstacles
- A giant screen in the center plays a Youtube video that is synchronsouly shared with everyone else in the room (in other words, everyone is watching the same thing
at the same time.)

There's more to do than just communicate in DJ3D. Given that the environment is fully 3D, the developer has built a climbing/parkour style course that wraps around the full space of the room! Form a line and see who can make it the farthest without falling off. Be warned, you could get sucked into doing this for a _loooong time_

## Banger.Digital
<p><strong>Link:</strong> <a href="https://banger.digital/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://banger.digtal/</a></p>
<em>Banger</em> deserves a notable mention in this category. It was one of the first of these to pop-up during quarantine. Instead of aiming for the professional set though, <em>Banger</em> aims for 100% "House Party" vibes, brah. So don't expect a set of desks for your virtual guests to sit at...instead picture them playing beer pong in the living room.

They to give you:
- A customizable avatar you choose before entering.
- Music that plays for all users to hear.
- Spatial audio, so you can hear only the users within your space.

Unfortunately with Banger the only room you can join _for free_ is the public room, leaving your party wide open to being crashed by complete strangers. - Private rooms will cost you anywhere from $3 to $50 month depending on the features you need.

There's a seemingly endless supply of tools like this to help make remote communication easier...
and quite frankly more fun! (Mozilla Hubs)

It's also notable that my original search for tools like this was to find a way for my work team
to connect and socialize for Friday happy hours. What I didn't expect was that some of tools
were so well liked that we've started using them during the work day as a means of talking about
projects, having off hours, knowledge drops, etc.

These tools truly are what you make them.
