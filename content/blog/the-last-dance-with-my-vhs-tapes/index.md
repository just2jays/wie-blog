I always have trouble getting rid of old stuff. My drawers are filled with old iPods, iPod Nanos, and iPhones from the 3G all the way up to the iPhone 7. Cabinets with iPads, Android tablets, and Chromebooks co-mingling. When I'm picking a shirt out at the start of the day, they're hanging above a bin of all my old CDs. (Seriously though I'm never parting with my og copy of ["Turn The Radio Off" by Reel Big Fish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn_the_Radio_Off).)

Bins of old video games, a handful of cassettes, and a large selection of vinyl I hand picked from a short stint with estate sales. These are all things I keep and will likely come with me on my next move.

What's not going to make it? **My VHS tapes**.

I came to this decision just based on their sheer size and utility. The amount of space they take up isn't worth it for the amount of pleasure I receive from them, which is none. (Thanks [Marie Kondo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Kondo)!) I don't own a VHS player, no one I know of has a VHS player. I'm aware I can have them "digitized", so that they would be just like any other movie file on my computer...but Netflix/Hulu/Amazon Prime/etc.

All of this said, there was a time when these tapes _did_ bring joy and for that reason, they deserve recognition. Each will have a link where you can find more info and probably even stream them if you wanted to. They'll be ordered descending based on how I'd star rank them. (This is my blog. I'm the blogtain now.)

Without further ado, I present to you...my VHS collection:

# The VHS Holdouts

## Dumb and Dumber
**My Rating:** ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️  
**Link:** [Stream "Dumb and Dumber"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aFOoX3TAs8) (Costs $!)

Let's get serious, this movie was and still is a national treasure. It formed 3/4 of the lexicon I use in every communication and I can quote it from front to back ("Quitsies, no anti-quitsies, no startsies!")

Of course, Jim Carrey was primed for this role and you had seen his antics on shows like, ["In Living Color"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Living_Color)...but Jeff Daniels. He was not on any young person's radar. This was my intro to Jeff Daniels, and because of his role as Harry Dunne, I've followed him ever since. 

## Weekend At Bernie's
**My Rating:** ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️  
**Link:** [Stream "Weekend at Bernie's"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aFOoX3TAs8) (Costs $!)

This movie had me laughing non-stop as a kid and thinking back on it...the humor was certainly a bit over my head when I was watching. I think it was just the concept of pretending to keep the dead guy alive like a marionette. Great premise then, still a great premise. Whatever happened to this franchise? If my memory serves me there were 1 or 2 more. I can see it making a comeback.

## Independence Day
**My Rating:** ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️  
**Link:** [Stream "Independence Day"](https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/independence-day/id272967721) (Costs $!)

This one pushed the limits of the big screen when it released. Owning it on VHS meant re-creating the action at home, anytime. Will Smith, the [Fresh Prince of Bel-Air](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fresh_Prince_of_Bel-Air), and alien invasions. There was laughter, there was action, there was patriotism...this movie provided then and it still does now.

## Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
**My Rating:** ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️  
**Link:** [Stream "Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me"](https://play.hbomax.com/feature/urn:hbo:feature:GXdu2UAdZUKXCPQEAADfG?camp=googleHBOMAX) (Costs $!)

This was the second in the series of Austin Powers flicks. At the time of release, you might have heard it referred to as, "the one with Heather Graham" or the one with "Fat Bastard" in it. Instantly you're transported to a simpler time. A time when people were [randomly screaming, "Get in my belly!"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXekH_8vXnM).

I received this VHS as a birthday gift from a family member. Now that I remember that, I kinda don't wanna throw it out. No no no....I digress. I bid you adieu.

## Big Daddy
**My Rating:** ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️  
**Link:** [Stream "Big Daddy"](https://www.netflix.com/title/21303955?source=35) (Costs $!)

[Adam Sandler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Sandler) was my idol in the high school years. From his hilarious skits on SNL, to his music endeavors, and a pantheon of hit movies, he was "funny" to an entire generation. Big Daddy had all the usual suspects from his movies but certainly tugged on the heart strings a little more than usual (OK, not compared to "[Spanglish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanglish_(film))" but most others.)

## Cinema Paradiso
**My Rating:** ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️  
**Link:** [Stream "Cinema Paradiso"](https://www.hulu.com/movie/cinema-paradiso-directors-cut-5b2bb897-5c6f-46c0-bbae-8d36cb1b51eb?entity_id=5b2bb897-5c6f-46c0-bbae-8d36cb1b51eb) (Costs $!)

An absolute cinematic masterpeice. LOL - We watched this movie in my high school  language class as a means of learning by hearing the language spoken fluently (the movie is all in Italian). It starts with a boy who befriends a local movie projectionist. It follows the boy as he gets older, and the projectionist does too...you can see where I'm going here without even watching the movie. It's a tearjerker and somehow captivated the class in a way that no other movie could (Which is saying a lot because hearing, "We're going to watch a movie today..." at the start of a high school class was a pretty awesome thing.)

## Johnny Stecchino
**My Rating:** ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️  
**Link:** [More info about "Johnny Stecchino"](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102164/)

Wait a minute....another Italian movie? Yes, another Italian movie. This teacher was _reel_ good. This one is a comedy, starring legendary Italian actor and Academy Award winner [Roberto Benigni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Benigni) as a general goofy guy who somehow gets involved with the mob. It's funny, it's silly, it's perfect. I wish I could find a legal way to stream it...I will update if one comes around during my travels.

## The Addams Family
**My Rating:** ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️  
**Link:** [More info about "The Addams Family"](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101272/)

You don't need me to wax poetic about this one. Dark comedy, yada yada. This must have been a gift. I'm not into this franchise and yet...here I am with it on VHS...29 years after release.

## Hardware Wars
**My Rating:** ⭐️ ⭐️  
**Link:** [More info about "Hardware Wars"](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077658/)

I honestly can't tell you how I obtained this. I remember being a kid who, like most kids and some grown adults, was enamored with the "Star Wars" franchise. This is a spoof of that...one of much lesser quality than the [Mel Brooks classic, "SpaceBalls"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceballs). There must have been an infomercial for it or something that originally brought it to my attention.

I can remember popping it into the VHS player, pressing play and just being really confused by the...lack of production value. Literally the main character's name is **Fluke Starbucker**. Come on. At the time I didn't really understand that was sort of part of the gimmick. How long could I  It was also less than 15 minutes long. So regardless of how it came into my posession, it was a ripoff. LOL It does look like this movie has since taken on sort of a "cult classic" vibe.

## The Underground Comedy Movie
**My Rating:** ⭐️ ⭐️  
**Link:** [More info about "The Underground Comedy Movie"](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0201290/)

This one I _can_ tell you how I obtained it...but I wish I forgot. I was in my college dorm room, freshman year, watching on-campus television when a commercial came on for this movie. It had drugs, sex, rock & roll. It had cameos from famous people. How could it be bad? (Hint: it's awful. Like...considered by some as one of [the worst films of all time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_films_considered_the_worst), awul.)

We were so excited when it came, we played it immediately in one of staple dorm style TVs that had the built in VHS player. Maybe 20 minutes in, zero laughs were had, we turned it off and realized we had wasted the 10.99 + shipping and handling or whatever it was buying it off a tv commercial through snail mail.

There you have it. Thanks for joining me on this journey through my VHS collection. Again, this was an exercise in "letting go" and I will be throwing all of the above VHS tapes into the garbage in the next couple of weeks. If you'd like the purchase or save one of these VHS tapes...reach out to me using the Twitter link all over this site.
