title: My Personal 2021 Year In Webpage Bookmarks
date: "2022-01-01T00:00:01.300Z"
description: "2021 was a great year for the web. Lots of new apps, software, the metaverse, crypto & web3 trends took center stage. I bookmarked a lot of stuff and it's time to dump it and start anew!"
tags: ["2021", "new year", "web3", "bookmarks", "metaverse"]

Every year I take stock of the web bookmarks I've accumulated and do some organization. It's nice to trim the fat a bit and start the new year fresh, with everything easy to find. I'm the kind of person who longs for the return of a site like the og `del.icio.us` - a database of all my bookmarks, tagged appropriately, and shareable with anyone. Sure there are bookmark services but I find none compare to the utility and simplicity of delicious, especially at the _free_ price point.

But I digress...

Instead I have my own organizational method:

1. **KEEPERS** - these are bookmarks that I use frequently. They're sites I visit daily or often enough that I keep them at the top of my bookmark manager (and almost always as part of the browsers bookmark "bar".)
2. **GONERS** - these are bookmarks that were _formerly_ **KEEPERS** but through the year have become stale, no longer exist, etc.
3. **ARCHIVE** - these are pretty much everything else. Sites I thought were cool, interesting, important, 

Hopefully, if you're reading this, you find something cool or interesting or useful. Otherwise...this is mostly a personal storage of the sites I picked up in the year 2021. Not an insignificant year either with COVID, the global pandemic, and all. You'll find that many of the bookmarks are closely tied to this current event. There are a lot of tools for communication, both socially and professionally. There are sites for gaming, reading, and writing for keeping your sanity (and sites for local news and events to re-destroy it again!) - Certain sites clearly gained a boost, became more useful or important, due to the COVID pandemic. I've denoted those with the stars emoji.

Without further ado...the list:

### KEY
- âœ¨: COVID boost
- âœ…: KEEPER material
- ðŸª™: Crypto concepts

# Keepers
Keepers are sites that continue to provide information, entertainment, or some other utility that is accessed frequently. Think things like weather apps, check-in services, news sources, etc.
- [EarthCam](https://www.earthcam.com/)
  - With all this remote work, I've found it more interesting than ever to be able to peek at the outside world. EarthCam has been a really fun way to do this.
- [Google Trends](https://www.google.com/trends/)
  - A neat way to see what people are talking about.
- [RAWG](https://rawg.io/)
  - A database of video games that allows you to collect, categorize, and check-in to your personal games.
- [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/)
  - A legend in the game!
- [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org)
  - My first, and favorite, metaverse.
- [ProductHunt](https://producthunt.com)
  - Find the next best product, it's like "Shark Tank" of the web.
- [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/)
  - THE "it" NFT marketplace at the moment imo. 
- [Untappd](https://untappd.com)
  - A database of beer that allows you to collect, categorize, and check-in to the beers you imbibe!
- [Trakt](https://trakt.tv)
  - A database of TV shows & movies that allows you to collect, categorize, and check-in to the beers you imbibe!

# Goners
Goners are former keepers that have lost their time in the bookmark sun. Great websites, with lots to offer, but just not something to check out on a consistent basis anymore.
- [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/)
  - No doubt a great place to spend some time and stay up on the next trends...but I find those things coming to me these days without having to do much searching, thanks to social media.
