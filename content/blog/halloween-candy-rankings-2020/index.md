With Halloween hot on our heels, it's important to think about the candy you are giving out to the neighborhood. We're about 3 weeks away now, which mean this is really your last chance to stock up on the "good stuff".

# How can I tell the good stuff from the bad stuff?
Halloween comes and goes every year, but the candy every kid yearns for pretty much stays consistent.

Here are some quick tips and important tricks so that you can ace the Halloween canddy game, before dive into the individual candy rankings:

1. Safety first! Do **NOT** server loose/unwrapped or unpackaged candy. Let's be honest it just looks shady and even given the greatest of intentions, will be thrown out upon inspection by any sensible adult (and almost all sensible children.)

2. It's important to go to the grocery store early. You _do not_ want to be the house on the block with the crap candy  because, "that was all they had left." - so most importantly, write down/print out this list and get buying these chandies immediately!.

3. **Bigger Is Better** - A common phrase that no doubt also comes into play when talking about Halloween candy. The bigger the candy you give, the more talked about/bragged about your house will be among the local trick-or-treaters. If you enjoy handing out Halloween candy every year, no doubt giving a full size candy bar will ensure your house is a "must stop" along most trick-or-treater routes.

# The Rankings
So now that you have some tips, lets get to the good stuff. The rankings. The best candy, which will be sure to get you high trick-or-treating grades, will be at the top. The lower on the list you go, the more likely you're giving out junk that no one will eat.

**NOTE:** These rankings are skewed due to the "goodie bag" - when you give a goodie bag, no one knows whats inside. It's effectively treasure and therefore supercedes the candy rankings. (Great choice goodie bag givers!)

1. [Twix](https://twix.com/) (Full Bar > Minis)
2. [Snickers](https://marschocolate.com/snickers) (Full Bar > Minis)
3. [Reese's Peanut Butter Cups](https://www.hersheys.com/reeses/)
4. [Blow Pop](https://www.tootsie.com/candy/charms/charms-blow-pops) (You can't beat the longevity of a blow pop. Lollipop with gum in the center. One of these is like an hour of joy.)
5. [Butterfinger](https://www.butterfinger.com/)
6. [KitKat](https://www.hersheys.com/kitkat/) (4 pack > 2 pack)
7. [Almond Joy/Mounds](https://www.hersheys.com/almondjoy-mounds/) (Effectively the same thing. Requires a well refined palate though.)
8. [Milky Way](https://marschocolate.com/milky-way)
9. [Toosie Pop](https://www.tootsie.com/candy/tootsie-pops/tootsie-pops) (Same longevity as the Blow Pop, but weaker flavors.)
10. [Starburst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starburst_(candy)) (Do **not** give them out individualy. Packet of 2 minimum.)
11. [Reese's Pieces](https://www.hersheys.com/reeses/)
12. [M&M](https://www.mms.com/)
13. [Skittles](https://skittles.com/) (A fruit flavored M&M)
14. [Hershey Bar](https://www.hersheys.com/) (Rare to see a candy bar ranked so low. If you still wanna go this route, pick a filler like "With Almonds".)
15. [Three Musketeers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3_Musketeers_(chocolate_bar))
16. [Dum Dums](https://www.dumdumpops.com/) (Again it's the longevity that keeps these smaller lollipops in the middle of the pack.)
17. [Jolly Ranchers](https://www.hersheys.com/jolly-rancher/)
18. [Sour Warheads](https://warheads.com/)
19. [Whoppers](https://www.hersheys.com/whoppers/) (No one goes out of their way to eat these, but they can be good when you least expect it.)
20. [Airheads](https://airheads.com/)
21. [Gummy Worms/Bears](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gummy_bear) (Watch Rule #1 above, make sure these are packaged, not individual.)
22. [Laffy Taffy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laffy_Taffy) (Interchangeable with the below "Now & Later" - these are just teeth destroyers and even kids realize it.)
23. [Now & Later](https://www.nowandlater.com/)
24. [Swedish Fish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_Fish)
25. [Tootsie Rolls](https://tootsie.com/)
26. [Smarties](https://www.smarties.com/)
27. [Twizzlers](https://www.hersheys.com/twizzlers/) (These will be used as whips and weaponry by costumed kids more than they will be eaten.)
28. [Mike and Ike](https://www.mikeandike.com/) (You might remember it fondly...but kid's these days will not.)
29. Generic Lollipop (No branding, just clear wrapped, colored suckers...for suckers!)
30. [Candy Corn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candy_corn) (Careful here, you're probably breaking good stuff/bad stuff Rule #1 above!)

# Where to get the good stuff?
Now that you know what you should be buying, here's where you can purchase these candies and more. Now is the time act and getting in early means you can take advantage of all the great deals stores are offering especially for the Halloween season.

- [Amazon](halloween candy): You buy everything else you need off Amazon, so why not candy? Perfect for buying bulk if you're expecting a lot of trick or treaters in your neighborhood. Not to mention, if you're an "Amazon Prime" member - you can take advantage of the 2 day shipping on all your candy needs.

- [Target](https://www.target.com/c/halloween-candy-treats/-/N-55hso?Nao=0): If you're not keen to shopping online, a trip to your nearest Target would surely be your next best bet. They have every candy I mentioned above in stock and often have entire aisles devoted to Halloween candy.  In fact, right now, they're [running a sale where select Halloween candy is only $4.99!](https://www.target.com/c/halloween-trick-or-treat-candy/-/N-4rt96Z5tdv0Ztb9f0?type=products)

- Bulk Shopping Warehouses (Costco, BJ's, Sam's Club, etc.): These larger warehouse stores offer candy _in bulk_, and have the added benefit of often selling costumes in the same dept. It's an all-in-one Halloween stop.
