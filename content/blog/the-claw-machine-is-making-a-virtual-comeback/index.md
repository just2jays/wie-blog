The skill games area of the local fairs or carnivals has always been my jam.

_You know it._ Generally toward the middle of the fair, on the outer edges. A little past the zeppole trucks but well before the [Scrambler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrambler_(ride)) and the [Gravitron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitron) (I was a one and done with that.)

This area can cover a large swath of games. So as a self-described expert in the field of skill gamery, I categorize them into two categories:

1. **Physical** - Games that require you to physically do something skillful.
    - "Smack the frog onto the lily pad!"
    - "Throw this ball, through that net/into that bucket!"
    - "Whack these moles!"
    - "Hit this thing with a jackhammer and ring the bell!"

  (*_Please read above in your best carnie voice._)

2. **Non-phsyical** - Games that are mostly _luck_ but _could_ involve skill.
    - Drop a coin into the slot and try to push _more_ coins off (aka "The Coin Pusher"...or according to Wikipedia, the [Medal game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_game))
    - Find something you want in this glass box, and maneuver a claw to grab it. Succeed, and it's yours...

...that's right...

# The Claw Machine
The claw machine is one of the greatest non-physical games to ever exist. There I said it. Nothing beats it. Firstly you get to inspect the machine first hand. You know there's nothing fishy _from the outside_, and that's important. Sure they can control the tightness/grip of the claw itself. Sure I've heard the rumors of how said grip actually changes based on how frequently the last prize was won. (i.e. The more no one wins, the tighter the grip gets...until someone wins, then it gets _very_ loose again.)

Here we are though, October 2020. Smack in the middle of a global COVID-19 pandemic and quarantined inside for the forseeable future. A time when even professional sports are struggling to find a way to play their games and while simultaneously meeting social distancing rules for player and fan safety. I don't even know what I'm saying but I do know this doesnt bode well for the local town fair and skill games area.

Have no fear...the internet is here.

Streaming live video and audio has become common place now and the hardware/software to do so is generally cheap and one time investment. Our homes are always connected, WiFi is everywhere. With this, comes a number of companesi and individuals who are bringing these games back to the people thanks to this modern capability of the web.

# The Games
## SubBass' #BigClaw on remo.tv
**LINK:** [https://remo.tv/SubBass100/rbot-85e6cd73-cdae-47bd-85d1-7907e523bf32](https://remo.tv/SubBass100/rbot-85e6cd73-cdae-47bd-85d1-7907e523bf32)

This is far and away the greatest claw to grace the web...and as far as I know there is only person behind it. That is the user **SubBass100** on the site [remo.tv](https://remo.tv), a community of hackers and tinkerers who essentially build robots, and hook them up to the internet to be controlled by strangers. (I _HIGHLY_ recommend you checking that site out when you have the time. I'm going to keep going on about the Big Claw but some talented people make some great things there!)

SubBass100 has taken the claw machine and connected it to the internet so that anyone can control the claw direction (up, down, left, right) via their keyboard. It's seemingly in a living room somewhere, maybe a basement?

He's set up a pair of cameras. One that gives you the traditional front facing view of the machine, just like you'd get if you were standing in front of it. Another camera is actually _mounted to the claw_ giving you a birds eye view of the prize underneath. The camera even includes a crosshair, to let you really pinpoint what you're trying to grab. This small tweak, something you couldn't do with a real-live machine, adds a totally new element to the skill of the game. You can use it to tell how many taps in what direction are required to get the claw just where you need it. If you miss? Adjust and try again! Don't forget to use the "poke" option which will drop a closed claw. (Sort of a dry run to test your position.) - Just check it out, it's great and it's amazing that such a simple skill claw game can still be tweaked to add a new bit of strategy and fun.

- **Completely Free** to play to the public (don't forget to share if other users are around!)
- You **DO NOT** get to actually kep the prizes. SubBass100 actually re-stocks the machine when it gets low with the same toys. (If you're playing at the right time and it's low enough, you'll see it!)
- Chat system built into the site makes for a more casual, fun, and social environment.
- Playable on desktop or mobile (though a bit unwieldy on mobile via  web browser)

## ClawCraziness
**LINK:** [https://clawcraziness.live/](https://clawcraziness.live/)

This site really attempts to bring the _non-physical_ carnival games experience into your home. Unlike SubBass100 above, ClawCraziness is run by a team of people who are turning the virtual claw experience into a business. Not stopping at a single machine, there are 5 machines to play here. 4 claws and lo and behold...a real, live, internet connected _coin pusher_!

_The catch?_ Just like the real world, you have to use real money for tries. You pay for tokens and when you win "tickets", just like you would at the arcade. You redeem tickets for prizes. **More tickets = better prizes!**

- Pay real money for attempts (Anywhere from $5 - $100 depending how many tokens you want)
- Win tickets which can be redeemed for real prizes (As in you provide your home address, they will mail it to you!)
- More than just claws, you can play the coin pusher games as well!
- Well made website with user accounts and a leaderboard

A really fun, well made experience. If you're serious about claw, you can't go wrong with this.

## Toreba
**LINK:** [https://www.toreba.net/](https://www.toreba.net/)

Toreba is the OG of web based claw machines. I first stumbled upon it pre-COVID as an app on the iPhone at which point my co-workers all proceeded to download it and the rest of a productive work day had effectively come to an end.

Toreba is run by a japanese video game developer and you can tell right away by the design aesthetic and another super unique thing...these use an 2 pronged claw rather than the 3 pronged claw that we are used to here in most of the Western world.

With Toreba, like ClawCraziness and Clawee, you do have to pay real currency for machine plays. However you can choose from a large number of machines that offer different prizes...and with Toreba, you _do_ win the prize you grab. (It's not a ticket redemption system.)

- Pay real money for attempts (Anywhere from $5 - $300 depending on how much "tp" you want)
- Playable on desktop or mobile via a fully native mobile app.
- The prize you win is the prize you keep, and it will be mailed to the address you provide on signup.
- Wide array of machines, some traditional, others I've never even seen

The only downside I've found is that there's a significant delay in when you move tell the calw to move vs. when you actually see the claw move. I suspect the Toreba servers are not based anywhere near where I am playing. Claw beggars can't be claw choosers.

If you want the skill game concept but with a little twist, Toreba is a fine option. There's even a game I had never seen before where instead of a claw, you aim and drop a sharp pointy object and hope to accurately cut thru a small peice of paper. Outlandish I tell you.

## Clawee
**LINK:** [https://clawee.com/](https://clawee.com/)

Clawee is very similar to Toreba above, but with a much more welcoming and inviting design. The app is clean, the buttons are sharp, there clearly was an emphasis on UI and UX during development of the app. The game loads and streams really snappy. Otherwise, very similar gameplay to the others. A large number of machines and some very nice prizes.

- Pay real money for attempts (Anywhere from $3 - $300 depending on how many coins you want.)
- Playable on desktop or mobile via a fully native mobile app (Desktop version though isn't exactly easy to play. Appears to be some sort of emulated version of the mobile app.)
- Wide array of _ONLY_ claw machines

# In Con-claw-sion

As you can see, the claw crane game is alive and well. Even though our fairs are postponed and the arcades are off-limits (either legally or just, ew who wants to go into them these days) - you can still get your skill game kicks on your computer or phone. Check them out, tell your friends, and enjoy your claw-rantine. (Ok...done with the claw puns.)
